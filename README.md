#Transport-Society-LandingPage
 This project was given to me by a
 digital web agency as a recruitement exercise, it was finished within 20 hours over the course of 6 days.
 The challenge was to first create a responsive figma prototype and then code the front-end.

 To accomplish this challenge I proceeded in the following way : 
 1)Reception and brief analysis
 2)UI responsive design 
 3)HTML structuring 
 4)Javascript programming : Image caroussel, Filter buttons, Dynamic content injection, Burger Menu toggle 
 5)CSS : Desktop/Tablet/Mobile
 6)Detail animations
